## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Social media feed integration | Site is a destination, content lives on social platforms |
| Blog/CMS | Content lives on social media; site is static for v1 |
| Client portal/login | This is marketing only, not a product |
| E-commerce/payments | Services are custom-quoted, not self-service |
| Complex animations | Professional and fast, not flashy |
| Pricing page | Custom quotes only, no published pricing for v1 |
| Live chat | Telegram notification enables fast response without chat complexity |
