# Procevo AI Website

## What This Is

A marketing website for Procevo AI, an automation and AI consulting firm targeting mid-market companies ($750K-$100M revenue). The site serves as a landing page for social media traffic from "building in public" content, converting visitors into discovery calls by showcasing results, founder credibility, and making contact frictionless.

## Core Value

Visitors immediately understand the pain Procevo solves (stretched teams drowning in repetitive work and disconnected systems) and can reach out within seconds — because speed of response wins deals.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Homepage communicates pain points and solutions clearly (results-focused, not tech-focused)
- [ ] Services section covers both custom automation/AI projects and consulting (processes/SOPs)
- [ ] Case study section with at least one example (invoice splitter)
- [ ] Testimonials section (structure ready, content to come)
- [ ] Founder/About section highlighting 20+ years of experience
- [ ] Contact form that sends email and triggers Telegram notification
- [ ] Fast, professional design that builds trust with mid-market executives
- [ ] Mobile-responsive
- [ ] Deployed to Vercel

### Out of Scope

- Social media feed integration — site is a destination, not a content aggregator
- Blog/CMS — content lives on social platforms, site is static
- Client portal/login — this is marketing only
- E-commerce/payments — services are custom-quoted
- Complex animations/interactions — professional and fast, not flashy

## Context

**Target market:** Corporations doing $750K-$100M in revenue. Primary industry is manufacturing, but open to professional services, higher education (enrollment/applications), and any organization with manual processes across disconnected systems.

**Pain points to address:**
1. Teams stretched thin handling both routine/repetitive tasks AND high-value work
2. Manual data entry repeated across multiple disconnected systems
3. Processes that should be automated but "we've always done it this way"

**Messaging philosophy:** Talk about results and pain relief, not the fancy tools and software. Executives care about outcomes, not implementation details.

**First case study:** Invoice splitter for manufacturing client — they send one email with a multi-invoice PDF, automation splits it into separate PDFs and returns individual emails for NetSuite AP module (which only accepts one invoice per file).

**Founder positioning:** Strong personal presence. 20+ years in technology, business building, and process development. The company is Procevo AI, but trust comes from the founder's track record.

**Contact flow:** Form submission → email to Jake → immediate Telegram notification → fast personal response. Speed of reply is a key differentiator.

## Constraints

- **Hosting**: Vercel — already has other projects there, no need for VM/DigitalOcean
- **Design**: Professional, trustworthy, fast-loading — appropriate for B2B mid-market audience
- **Messaging**: Results-first, avoid jargon and tool names

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Static marketing site (no CMS) | Content lives on social media, site is destination only | — Pending |
| Vercel hosting | User preference, already has projects there | — Pending |
| Email + Telegram for contact notifications | Speed of response is competitive advantage | — Pending |
