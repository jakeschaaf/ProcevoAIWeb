<objective>
Integrate case studies strategically across the site following the hybrid placement pattern - dedicated hub + embedded throughout for maximum discoverability and contextual relevance.

Purpose: Trust signals positioned throughout the site (not isolated on one page) improve conversion by providing social proof at critical decision points.

Output: Case study sections on homepage and services page, dedicated case studies page, updated navigation with Case Studies link.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add case study section to homepage</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the homepage to include a case study section between PainPoints and CTA. The section should:

1. Import CaseStudyCard from '@/components/case-study-card'
2. Import invoiceSplitterCaseStudy from '@/data/case-studies'
3. Import Container from '@/components/ui/container'

4. Add section after PainPoints, before CTA:
```tsx
<section className="py-20 md:py-28 bg-gray-50">
  <Container size="lg">
    <div className="text-center mb-12">
      <p className="text-sm font-medium text-brand-500 tracking-widest uppercase mb-4">
        Proof It Works
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-display text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl text-gray-900 tracking-tight">
        Real Results
      </h2>
    </div>

    <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
      <CaseStudyCard {...invoiceSplitterCaseStudy} />
    </div>

    <div className="text-center mt-10">
      <a
        href="/case-studies"
        className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 text-brand-500 hover:text-brand-600 font-medium transition-colors"
      >
        View All Case Studies
        <svg className="w-4 h-4" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth={2}>
          <path strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round" d="M17 8l4 4m0 0l-4 4m4-4H3" />
        </svg>
      </a>
    </div>
  </Container>
</section>
```

The section uses bg-gray-50 to provide visual rhythm (alternating light/dark sections).
  </action>
  <verify>Homepage renders with case study section visible: `npm run build` succeeds</verify>
  <done>Homepage displays invoice splitter case study with "Proof It Works" heading and visible metrics</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add case study section to services page</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/services/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add a case study section to the services page after the "Our Process" section and before the CTA. This provides contextual social proof near the service offerings.

1. Import CaseStudyCard from '@/components/case-study-card'
2. Import invoiceSplitterCaseStudy from '@/data/case-studies'

3. Add section between Process section and CTA:
```tsx
<section className="py-20 md:py-28 bg-white">
  <Container size="lg">
    <div className="text-center mb-12">
      <p className="text-sm font-medium text-brand-500 tracking-widest uppercase mb-4">
        See It In Action
      </p>
      <h2 className="font-display text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl text-gray-900 tracking-tight mb-4">
        Real Projects, Real Results
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
        Here&apos;s what we&apos;ve built for companies just like yours.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div className="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
      <CaseStudyCard {...invoiceSplitterCaseStudy} />
    </div>
  </Container>
</section>
```

Uses bg-white to alternate with the bg-gray-50 process section above it.
  </action>
  <verify>Services page renders with case study section: `npm run build` succeeds</verify>
  <done>Services page shows case study section after process steps, before CTA</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Create dedicated case studies page</name>
  <files>app/(marketing)/case-studies/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Create a dedicated case studies hub page at app/(marketing)/case-studies/page.tsx:

1. Create the case-studies directory under app/(marketing)/
2. Create page.tsx with:

```tsx
import type { Metadata } from 'next';
import { Hero } from '@/components/hero';
import { CaseStudyCard } from '@/components/case-study-card';
import { CTA } from '@/components/cta';
import { Container } from '@/components/ui/container';
import { allCaseStudies } from '@/data/case-studies';

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'Case Studies',
  description:
    'Real automation projects with measurable results. See how we help mid-market companies save time and eliminate errors.',
  openGraph: {
    title: 'Case Studies - Procevo AI',
    description:
      'Real automation projects with measurable results for mid-market companies.',
  },
};

export default function CaseStudiesPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <Hero
        headline="Real Results for Real Companies"
        subheadline="We don't just talk about automation—we build it. Here's what we've accomplished for companies just like yours."
        primaryCTA="Start Your Project"
        primaryCTALink="/contact"
      />

      <section className="py-20 md:py-28 bg-white">
        <Container size="lg">
          <div className="grid gap-8 lg:gap-10">
            {allCaseStudies.map((caseStudy, index) => (
              <div key={index} className="max-w-3xl mx-auto w-full">
                <CaseStudyCard {...caseStudy} />
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>

          {allCaseStudies.length === 1 && (
            <div className="mt-16 text-center">
              <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg">
                More case studies coming soon as we grow.
              </p>
            </div>
          )}
        </Container>
      </section>

      <CTA
        heading="Ready to become our next success story?"
        subheading="Let's talk about the manual work that's slowing your team down."
        ctaText="Schedule a Free Consultation"
        ctaLink="/contact"
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

The page uses allCaseStudies array to render all case studies, making it easy to add more in the future. Single case study has a "more coming soon" message.
  </action>
  <verify>Case studies page exists and renders: `npm run build` succeeds, verify page at /case-studies</verify>
  <done>Dedicated case studies page exists at /case-studies with invoice splitter case study</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 4: Update navigation with Case Studies link</name>
  <files>components/navigation.tsx</files>
  <action>
Update the navigation to include a Case Studies link. In components/navigation.tsx:

1. Add Case Studies to the navItems array (between Services and About):

```typescript
const navItems = [
  { href: '/', label: 'Home' },
  { href: '/services', label: 'Services' },
  { href: '/case-studies', label: 'Case Studies' },
  { href: '/about', label: 'About' },
];
```

No other changes needed - the navigation component already handles rendering all navItems.
  </action>
  <verify>Navigation shows Case Studies link: `npm run build` succeeds</verify>
  <done>Navigation includes Case Studies link between Services and About</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Run `npm run build` - builds successfully
2. Homepage shows case study section between pain points and CTA
3. Services page shows case study section after process steps
4. /case-studies page loads with Hero, case study card, and CTA
5. Navigation shows Case Studies link in both desktop and mobile views
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Invoice splitter case study appears on homepage with "Proof It Works" heading
- Invoice splitter case study appears on services page with "See It In Action" heading
- Dedicated /case-studies page exists with Hero and all case studies
- Navigation includes Case Studies link
- Trust signals distributed across multiple pages (not isolated)
- Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/03-trust-credibility-layer/03-02-SUMMARY.md`
