<objective>
Deploy the Next.js project to Vercel with automatic HTTPS and verify the deployment pipeline works.

Purpose: A deployed site fulfills TECH-05 (Deployed and live on Vercel), TECH-06 (HTTPS enabled), and enables Vercel Analytics to start tracking. This completes the foundation phase.

Output: A live website at a public URL with HTTPS, connected to GitHub for automatic deployments.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Initialize git repository and push to GitHub</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
If not already a git repository, initialize and make first commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial Next.js 16 project with Tailwind v4 and Vercel Analytics"
```

Create a new GitHub repository for the project (use `gh` CLI if available):
```bash
gh repo create ProcevoAIWeb --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

If `gh` CLI is not available or authenticated, provide instructions for manual GitHub repo creation.

Verify the repository exists and code is pushed:
```bash
git remote -v
git log --oneline -1
```
  </action>
  <verify>
`git remote -v` shows origin pointing to GitHub
`git log --oneline -1` shows the initial commit
  </verify>
  <done>
Code is committed and pushed to GitHub repository, ready for Vercel import.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Deploy to Vercel</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
Deploy using Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel --yes
```

The `--yes` flag accepts defaults:
- Links to existing project or creates new one
- Auto-detects Next.js framework
- Uses default build settings

If prompted for Vercel login, follow the browser authentication flow.

After deployment completes, the CLI outputs the deployment URL (e.g., `https://procevo-ai-web.vercel.app`).

Then link the Vercel project to GitHub for automatic deployments:
```bash
vercel link
vercel git connect
```

Or if using dashboard: Go to vercel.com/new, import the GitHub repository, and deploy.
  </action>
  <verify>
`vercel ls` shows the project
Deployment URL is accessible in browser
`.vercel/project.json` exists with projectId
  </verify>
  <done>
Site is deployed to Vercel with a public URL. Project is linked to GitHub for auto-deploy on push.
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Complete foundation infrastructure:
- Next.js 16 project with TypeScript and static export
- Tailwind CSS v4 design system with B2B color tokens
- Vercel Analytics integration
- Deployed to Vercel with HTTPS
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Visit the deployed URL (provided in Task 2 output)
2. Verify the page loads with:
   - Light gray background
   - "Procevo AI" heading in dark text
   - Blue "Get Started" button that darkens on hover
3. Check the URL starts with `https://` (HTTPS enabled)
4. Visit vercel.com/analytics and verify the project appears
5. (Optional) Make a small change, push to main, verify auto-deploy triggers

Expected: Site loads correctly with styling, HTTPS works, Analytics dashboard shows project.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

After all tasks complete:
1. Site is accessible at public URL
2. URL uses HTTPS (certificate valid)
3. Page displays correctly (Tailwind styles applied)
4. Vercel Analytics dashboard shows the project
5. `.vercel/project.json` exists in project root
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- TECH-05: Site is deployed and live on Vercel (public URL works)
- TECH-06: HTTPS is enabled (URL starts with https://, no certificate warnings)
- TECH-02: Vercel Analytics integrated (project visible in dashboard, will track page views)
- PAGE-08 (foundation): Responsive design system ready (Tailwind breakpoints configured)
- Deployment pipeline: Push to main triggers automatic build and deploy
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-infrastructure/01-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
