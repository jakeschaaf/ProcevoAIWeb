<objective>
Build the homepage with hero section, pain points, and CTA that passes the 5-second test

Purpose: Create the most important page of the site - the homepage that immediately communicates who Procevo helps (mid-market companies with stretched teams) and what they get (time back from automating manual work).
Output: Fully responsive homepage with outcome-focused hero, three pain points section, and clear CTA driving to contact.

  },
};
```

   - primaryCTA: "Schedule a Free Consultation"
   - primaryCTALink: "/contact"
   - secondaryCTA: "See How We Work"
   - secondaryCTALink: "/services"

   - points array with exactly 3 pain points:
     1. title: "Your Team is Stretched Thin"
        description: "Key people are buried in tasks that don't need human judgment. They're too busy putting out fires to work on what actually grows the business."
     2. title: "Manual Data Entry is Eating Your Day"
        description: "Hours lost to copying data between systems, fixing spreadsheet errors, and reconciling reports that should update themselves."
     3. title: "Your Systems Don't Talk to Each Other"
        description: "Information lives in silos. Getting a complete picture means logging into five different tools and hoping nothing falls through the cracks."

   - heading: "Ready to get your time back?"
   - subheading: "Let's talk about what's slowing your team down and how automation can help."
   - ctaText: "Schedule a Free Consultation"
   - ctaLink: "/contact"
