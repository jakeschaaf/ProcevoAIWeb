   "After two decades in operations and technology, I've seen the same story play out countless times: talented teams buried in manual work, disconnected systems creating chaos, and leadership too overwhelmed to fix it."

   Paragraph 2:
   "I started Procevo AI because I got tired of watching mid-market companies struggle with problems that shouldn't exist in 2026. The tools to eliminate manual data entry, connect your systems, and free up your team's time are here—but most companies don't have the bandwidth or expertise to implement them."

   Paragraph 3:
   "That's where I come in. I bring 20+ years of experience turning chaotic operations into smooth, automated workflows. Not with cookie-cutter solutions, but with custom automation built around how your team actually works."

   "Most mid-market companies know they're leaving money on the table with inefficient processes. They see competitors moving faster and wonder how. The answer isn't working harder—it's working smarter."

   Paragraph 3:
   "We exist to bridge the gap between where you are and where you want to be. Whether that means building a custom automation that saves 20 hours a week or mapping out your processes so you finally understand where the bottlenecks are, we're here to help."
