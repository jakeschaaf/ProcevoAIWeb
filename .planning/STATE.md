## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Vercel hosting — User preference, already has projects there
- Email + Telegram for contact notifications — Speed of response is competitive advantage
- Static export configuration — No server runtime needed for marketing site
- Tailwind CSS v4 — Using native CSS custom properties via @theme directive
