## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Static marketing site (no CMS) — Content lives on social media, site is destination only
- Vercel hosting — User preference, already has projects there
- Email + Telegram for contact notifications — Speed of response is competitive advantage
- Static export configuration — No server runtime needed for marketing site
- Tailwind CSS v4 — Using native CSS custom properties via @theme directive
- B2B color palette — Monochrome grays + blue brand accent using oklch color space
- Deployed to Vercel with automatic HTTPS — Production infrastructure operational
- GitHub integration for CI/CD on push — Automatic deployments enabled
- Navigation uses client component for mobile menu state — Interactive UI where needed
- Container size prop (sm/md/lg/xl) for consistent max-widths — Design system established
- Marketing layout uses route group for shared Navigation — Layout pattern set
- Outcome-focused headline — 5-second test optimization for immediate value clarity
- Three pain points structure — Addresses stretched teams, manual data entry, disconnected systems
- Component composition pattern — Hero + PainPoints + CTA for maintainable pages
- Photo placeholder approach — Allows deployment without blocking on professional photography
- About page structure — Hero → Founder → Company Story → Values → CTA
- ServiceCard component pattern — Structured format for service offerings (title, tagline, description, outcomes, idealFor)
